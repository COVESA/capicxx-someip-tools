##### Build Instructions for Linux

You can build all code generators by calling maven from the command-line. Open a console and change in the directory org.genivi.commonapi.someip.releng of your CommonAPI-Tools directory. Then call:

```bash
mvn -DCOREPATH=<path to your CommonAPI-Tools dir> -Dtarget.id=org.genivi.commonapi.someip.target clean verify
```
_COREPATH_ is the directory, that contains the target definition folder: `org.genivi.commonapi.someip.target`.

After the successful build you will find the commond-line generators archived in `org.genivi.commonapi.someip.cli.product/target/products/commonapi_someip_generator.zip` and the update-sites in `org.genivi.commonapi.someip.updatesite/target`.
